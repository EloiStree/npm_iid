# npm_iid

Index Integer Date (IID) is a transport format used to allow remote control through NTP and integers on a shared server.


This tool allows to convert iid to bytes and bytes to iid.
It also provide a Websocket client to push to a target public server.

If you need a private server, look at my other NPM on [WsMetaMaskAuth](https://github.com/EloiStree?tab=repositories&q=WsMetaMaskAuth&type=&language=&sort=)
